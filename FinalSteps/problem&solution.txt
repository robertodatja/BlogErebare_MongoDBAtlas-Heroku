SOLUTION:
This problem happens because the version of your package MongoDB is not the latest!So delete the mongoose package and re-install it again from Hyperterminal by using the command: npm i mongoose. Be sure that you are in the location of your project.

If there is any problem again:

I recommend deleting the blogDB database from Hyperterminal(Mongo Shell).

I recommend deleting both files package.json and package-lock.json.

After re-install all needed packages. In our case: npm i body-parser express ejs lodash mongoose.For more follow these links:
